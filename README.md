## Schema: `snp`

This is the primary schema that encapsulates all tables related to the S&P 500 data.

## Dimension Tables ðŸ§Š

Dimension tables provide descriptive context to the numerical data found in the fact table. They represent the "who, what, where, when, and why" of the data.

## Fact Table ðŸ“ˆ

The fact table contains the quantitative measurements or metrics of the business process being analyzed.

### `snp.stocks`

This table is the central fact table, storing daily stock performance data for each company.

**Primary Key:**
* `(time_id, comp_ticker)`: A composite key ensuring one record per company per day.

**Foreign Keys:**
* `fk_stocks_companies`: `comp_ticker` references `snp.companies(comp_ticker)`.
    * `ON UPDATE CASCADE`: If a `comp_ticker` in `snp.companies` is updated, it will also be updated here.
    * `ON DELETE RESTRICT`: Prevents deleting a company from `snp.companies` if it has related stock records.
* `fk_stocks_times`: `time_id` references `snp.times(time_id)`.
    * `ON UPDATE NO ACTION`, `ON DELETE NO ACTION`: No automatic changes if the related `time_id` in `snp.times` is updated or deleted (though `time_id` in `snp.times` is a primary key and usually stable).

**Relationships:**
* Connects to `snp.times` via `time_id` (many-to-one).
* Connects to `snp.companies` via `comp_ticker` (many-to-one).
